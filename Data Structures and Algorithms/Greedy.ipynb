For example, if we are choosing some elements and the problem wants us to find the maximum sum of elements we take, then given a choice between two numbers, it is optimal to take the larger one.\n",

    "\"Greedy\" isn't a data structure and it isn't any single algorithm either, but more of a way to approach a problem. As such, it's hard to become \"good\" at greedy algorithms, and there isn't much to \"learn\" about it. With that being said, this will be a short chapter mostly walking through examples. The concept of \"greedy\" is extremely general and the main thing to practice is recognizing when it applies. Greedy algorithms are usually very efficient, so if you are given a problem that can be solved greedily, it's important to recognize it."
