    "In this chapter, we will be learning about trees and graphs, which is probably the most common type of interview question (hash maps aren't really a \"type\" of question, and \"array\" or \"string\" is too broad). Trees and graphs are abstract data structures that show up everywhere in both the physical world and the software world. This is the longest chapter of the course, but for good reason. A huge amount of interview problems give trees or graphs as the input, and the entire problem is focused on them. As such, it is crucial that anyone going into a coding interview has a strong understanding of them.\n",

    "Let's start by revisiting what a node is. We looked at nodes in the linked lists chapter - recall that a node is an abstract data type with two things. First, a node stores data. This data can be whatever you want - an integer, a boolean, a hash map, your own custom objects, or all of the above. Second, a node stores pointers to other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is any collection of nodes and their pointers to other nodes. In fact, linked lists and trees are both types of graphs. As a topic, graphs are extremely broad. There is an entire field of study dedicated to graphs called graph theory.\n",

    "Even though a tree is a type of graph, trees and graphs are considered different topics when it comes to algorithm problems. Because graphs are the more advanced/difficult topic, we will start by looking at trees."

    "In a linked list, a node's pointer pointed to the next node. In a tree, a node has pointers to its children. If a node A is pointing to a node B, then B is a child of A, and A is the parent of B. The root is the only node that has no parent. Note that in a tree, a node cannot have more than one parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes a binary tree \"binary\"? In a binary tree, all nodes have a maximum of two children. These children are referred to as the left child and the right child. Note that there isn't really a difference between a child being on the left or the right, it's just the convention used to refer to the children and convenient for graphical representations.\n",

    "To summarize, a binary tree is a collection of nodes. Every node has between 0 to 2 children, and every node except the root has exactly one parent.\n",

    "Lastly, perhaps the most important thing to understand: a subtree of a tree is a node and all its descendants. Trees are recursive - you can treat a subtree as if it was its own tree with the chosen node being the root. What do we mean by this? Let's look at the company example again. The entire company is represented by the tree rooted at the CEO. But what if we only cared about the engineering department? Let's say the CTO has a direct report who is an SVP (Senior Vice President) of engineering, and all engineers are under this person. Take this SVP, and separate them from the rest of the company (remove their connection to the CTO). What are you left with? It's still a valid tree, but now the SVP is the root! This subtree now represents the engineering department instead of the entire company. This is the most fundamental idea for solving tree problems - you can take any given node and treat it as its own tree, which allows you to solve problems in a recursive manner.\n",
