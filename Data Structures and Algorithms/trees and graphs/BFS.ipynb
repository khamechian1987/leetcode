    "We mentioned earlier that in many problems, it doesn't matter if you choose preorder, inorder, or postorder DFS, the important thing is that you just visit all nodes. If you have a problem like this, then it doesn't matter if you use BFS either, because every \"visit\" to a node will store sufficient information irrespective of visit order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, in terms of binary tree algorithm problems, it is very rare to find a problem that using DFS is \"better\" than using BFS. However, implementing DFS is usually quicker because it requires less code, and is easier to implement if using recursion, so for problems where BFS/DFS doesn't matter, most people end up using DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, there are quite a few problems where using BFS makes way more sense algorithmically than using DFS. Usually, this applies to any problem where we want to handle the nodes according to their level. We'll see this in the upcoming example and practice problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an interview, you may be asked some trivia regarding BFS vs DFS, such as their drawbacks. The main disadvantage of DFS is that you could end up wasting a lot of time looking for a value. Let's say that you had a huge tree, and you were looking for a value that is stored in the root's right child. If you do DFS prioritizing left before right, then you will search the entire left subtree, which could be hundreds of thousands if not millions of operations. Meanwhile, the node is literally one operation away from the root. The main disadvantage of BFS is that if the node you're searching for is near the bottom, then you will waste a lot of time searching through all the levels to reach the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
